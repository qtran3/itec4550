Head Coach Chase Hodges
ALMA MATER: UNC-WILMINGTON

Chase Hodges is the first head coach in Georgia Gwinnett tennis history, and in his 
three-year stay in Lawrenceville, he's been named national coach of the year three 
times by the NAIA and twice by the Intercollegiate Tennis Association.

A decorated coach at all levels of collegiate tennis, Hodges delivered GGC its 
first-ever national titles in any sport with both the Men's and Women's 2014 NAIA 
National Championship titles. He was able to repeat the feat with the men this past 
year as he guided them to the 2015 crown while the women finished as the national 
runner-up.
