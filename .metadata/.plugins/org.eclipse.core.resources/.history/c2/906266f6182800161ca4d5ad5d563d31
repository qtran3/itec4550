        Some notes:
            * gap: is required only on iOS (when using UIWebView) and is needed for JS->native communication
            * https://ssl.gstatic.com is required only on Android and is needed for TalkBack to function properly
            * Disables use of inline scripts in order to mitigate risk of XSS vulnerabilities. To change this:
                * Enable inline JS: add 'unsafe-inline' to default-src

					<h3>Chase Hodges</h3>
					<h4>ALMA MATER: UNC WILMINGTON</h4>
					<p align="left">	Chase Hodges is the first head coach in Georgia Gwinnett tennis history, and in his three-year stay in Lawrenceville, he's been named national coach of the year three times by the NAIA and twice by the Intercollegiate Tennis Association. </p>
					<p align="left">	A decorated coach at all levels of collegiate tennis, Hodges delivered GGC its first-ever national titles in any sport with both the Men's and Women's 2014 NAIA National Championship titles. He was able to repeat the feat with the men this past year as he guided them to the 2015 crown while the women finished as the national runner-up.</p>
